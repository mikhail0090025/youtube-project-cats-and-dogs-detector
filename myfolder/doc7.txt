A Lengthy Conversation About Life, Plans, and Friends

Alice: Hey, Sarah, have you seen Tom lately? I think heâ€™s been avoiding us since we last hung out.

Sarah: Oh, I havenâ€™t, Alice! Maybe heâ€™s just busy with his new job. You know how he gets when they give him extra work. Iâ€™ll call him later and see whatâ€™s up with him.

Alice: Thatâ€™s a good idea! I miss hanging out with him. We used to have so much fun when you, me, and him would go to the park. Do you think heâ€™d join us if we asked?

Sarah: I hope so! He loves spending time with us. Last time, he told me he missed those days too. Maybe we should invite Jane as wellâ€”sheâ€™s been feeling left out lately. I saw her yesterday, and she said they donâ€™t include her in their plans anymore.

Alice: Poor Jane! I didnâ€™t know they were doing that to her. We should definitely ask her. Sheâ€™s always so nice to us. Iâ€™ll text her right now and see if sheâ€™s free. What do you think we should do if they all say yes?

Sarah: Oh, thatâ€™s exciting! I think we could take them to that new cafÃ© downtown. They say itâ€™s got amazing pastries, and you know how much he loves sweets. I bet heâ€™d drag us all there if we let him. What about youâ€”do you like that idea, or should we pick something else for us?

Alice: I love pastries too! Letâ€™s do it then. Iâ€™ll tell them to meet us there on Saturday. You and I can go early to grab a table for them. He might be late, thoughâ€”heâ€™s always keeping us waiting!

Sarah: Haha, true! He canâ€™t help it, I guess. They say heâ€™s got a lot on his plate these days. Speaking of which, have you talked to Mike? Heâ€™s been quiet lately, and I worry about him. We should check on him too.

Alice: Oh, I havenâ€™t seen him either! Youâ€™re rightâ€”we should reach out to him. Iâ€™ll ask her if she knows whatâ€™s going on with him. Maybe theyâ€™ve been keeping him busy at work too. We canâ€™t let him feel left out like they did with Jane.

Sarah: Good plan! Iâ€™ll call her later and see what she thinks. Weâ€™ve got to look after our friends, you know? They mean the world to us. What if we invite them all to a big get-together? You and I could organize it, and theyâ€™d all love it.

Alice: I love that idea! We could have it at my place. Iâ€™ll ask my brother to help us set it upâ€”heâ€™s good at this stuff. Theyâ€™ll be so surprised when we tell them. Do you think heâ€™d bring his guitar? He always cheers us up with it.

Sarah: Oh, I hope he does! That would make it perfect for them. We should tell her to bring some snacks tooâ€”sheâ€™s amazing at baking. I canâ€™t wait to see their faces when we surprise them all. You and I are going to make this the best day for us!

Alice: Definitely! Iâ€™ll start planning it with you. Weâ€™ll make sure they all feel included. He might even bring his dogâ€”this could turn into a pet party! What do you think theyâ€™d say if we did that?

Sarah: Haha, theyâ€™d love it! Heâ€™d be so excited to show off his pup to us. I bet sheâ€™d bring her cat too. We could turn it into a little competitionâ€”whose pet is the cutest! You and I would be the judges, of course.

Alice: Perfect! I canâ€™t wait to see them all together. Weâ€™ll have so much fun, and theyâ€™ll thank us for it. Letâ€™s get started right awayâ€”you and I have a lot to do!

Sarah: Agreed! Iâ€™ll tell them the plan tomorrow. Theyâ€™re going to be so happy with us. Letâ€™s make it a day theyâ€™ll never forget!
