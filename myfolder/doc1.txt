The Arduino Uno is a series of open-source microcontroller board based on a diverse range of microcontrollers (MCU). It was initially developed and released by
Arduino company in 2010. The microcontroller board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various
expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. The board has 14 digital I/O pins (six capable of PWM output), 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the
Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), via a type B USB cable. It can be powered by a USB cable or a barrel connector that accepts voltages between
7 and 20 volts, such as a rectangular 9-volt battery. It has the same microcontroller as the Arduino Nano board, and the same headers as the Leonardo board.

production files for some versions of the hardware are also available.

The word "uno" means "one" in Italian and was chosen to mark a major redesign of the Arduino hardware and software. The Uno board was the successor of the
Duemilanove release and was the 9th version in a series of USB-based Arduino boards. Version 1.0 of the Arduino IDE for the Arduino Uno board has now evolved
to newer releases. The ATmega328 on the board comes preprogrammed with a bootloader that allows uploading new code to it without the use of an external
hardware programmer.

While the Uno communicates using the original STK500 protocol,[1] it differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use a FTDI USB-to-UART serial chip.
Instead, it uses the Atmega16U2 (Atmega8U2 up to version R2) programmed as a USB-to-serial converter.
